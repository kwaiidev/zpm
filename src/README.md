# zpm-tuna

## info
zpm-tuna is version 2 of its original MVP at Knight Hacks 8, where it won first place in Pheratech ROS2 Autonomy Challenge.

zpm-tuna attempts at creating a new way to evacuate buildings in case of emergency. Modern evacuation routes are static, which can lead to panic as soon as one thing goes wrong. Tunas target relaying an optimal route based on current conditions so human lives dont have to do it on their own.
